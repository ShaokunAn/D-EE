### These codes are employed for validating the consistency of EE and D-EE. 
During the optimization process, we use the same initialization generating from original Matlab code by running GenerateX0.m. Therefore, this D-EE_matlabX0 code contains two inputs, one is the input of the original data, and the other is the input of the initialization X0, which are listed in makefile.
