### strong scaling and parallel efficiency results of D-EE.
The strong scaling performance is tested of D-EE using iPSCs dataset under 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 processes, respectively. 
These runtimes are listed in speedup_time.R.

Besides, the runtime vs sample size is also tested, with 10000, 50000, and 100000 samples. Firstly, these three datasets are the first N samples extracted from the iPSCs dataset. In order to save space, we have put the files of the first 100,000 samples here, and the remaining 50,000 and 10,000 samples can be obtained from the 100,000 samples through ipsc_time_testdata.R code.
