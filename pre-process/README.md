### Pre-process of three raw datasets
 
The PHATE data is a simulated data based on https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/PHATE/blob/master/Matlab/GenerateTree.m script.
Since there exists randomness and uncertainty of noise during data generation process, the resulting simulation data are roughly the same 
but there will still be minor differences. The data used in our study is provided as PHATE_Data.mat.

The raw HSPCs data is obtained from https://github.com/ManuSetty/wishbone/blob/master/data/sample_scseq_data.csv, 
and the iPSCs data is obtained from NCBI repository with number GSE122662.
